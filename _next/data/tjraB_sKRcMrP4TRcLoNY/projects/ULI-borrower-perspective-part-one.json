The UI shows a *range* and a **“Get Quote”** button that reveals the exact rate after a pre‑approval request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4️⃣ Credit‑Score & Eligibility Engine\r\n\r\n1. **Self‑service Score Calculator** – borrower inputs:\r\n   - Income / turnover\r\n   - Existing liabilities\r\n   - Repayment history (if any)\r\n2. **Simplified algorithm** (illustrative only):\r\n   - Base score = 300\r\n   - + 0.2 × (annual income in ₹ 000s)\r\n   - – 0.5 × (existing EMIs / income ratio)\r\n   - + 10 × (tenure of business / 5 years)\r\n3. **Result**: Score 300‑900, colour‑coded (Red, Amber, Green).\r\n\r\n> The real scoring model will be supplied by RBI’s “Digital Credit Scoring” sandbox.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 5️⃣ Loan Disbursement & Repayment – UPI‑style APIs\r\n\r\nULI re‑uses the proven **UPI transaction model** for moving loan funds. The following JSON specifications inform the borrower‑facing flow:\r\n\r\n### 5.1 Payment‑Link Creation\r\n- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/payment-links`\r\n- **Purpose**: Generate a one‑time payment link that the borrower can click to receive the loan amount.\r\n- **Key fields**:\r\n  - `amount`\r\n  - `currency`\r\n  - `merchantId` (the lender’s identifier)\r\n  - `callbackUrl` (for settlement notification)\r\n\r\n### 5.2 Bill‑Pay API\r\n- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/bills`\r\n- **Purpose**: Register a loan‑repayment bill that can be settled via UPI, NEFT, or other supported modes.\r\n- **Key fields**:\r\n  - `billAmount`\r\n  - `dueDate`\r\n  - `payerVPA` (borrower’s virtual payment address)\r\n  - `payeeVPA` (lender’s virtual payment address)\r\n\r\n### 5.3 Merchant‑Acquirer Map\r\n- Describes how a **merchant (lender)** is onboarded onto the UPI network and which **acquirers** (banks) will settle the funds.\r\n- Important for the borrower to see the **settlement schedule** and **settlement type** (Gross vs Net).\r\n\r\n**Merchant‑Acquirer flow**:\r\n```mermaid\r\nflowchart TD\r\n    A[Merchant Onboarding Request] --> B[Validate Merchant Details]\r\n    B --> C[Assign Acquirer Bank]\r\n    C --> D[Create VPA for Merchant]\r\n    D --> E[Merchant Ready for Transactions]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Borrower‑centric flow** (payment‑link → settlement):\r\n```mermaid\r\nflowchart TD\r\n    A[Loan Approved] --> B[Generate Payment Link]\r\n    B --> C[Borrower clicks link]\r\n    C --> D[UPI/NEFT transfer to lender VPA]\r\n    D --> E[Settlement Service posts status]\r\n    E --> F[Borrower sees Paid in app]\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 6️⃣ Access to Government Schemes\r\n\r\n- **MSME Credit Guarantee** – up to 75 % of loan amount guaranteed by the government.\r\n- **Startup India Fund** – low‑interest loans for tech‑driven startups.\r\n- **Agriculture Credit** – interest subsidies for farmers & agri‑SMEs.\r\n\r\n**How it appears**: A dedicated “Government Schemes” tab that filters lenders offering scheme‑backed loans, showing the subsidy percentage and eligibility.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 7️⃣ Forecast & Treasury Insight (RBI View)\r\n\r\n> *Optional note for the borrower*: “Your loan request helps the central bank forecast credit demand and plan liquidity.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 8️⃣ App Features for the Borrower\r\n\r\n### 8.1 Unified Dashboard\r\n- **Loan Portfolio**: Single view of all active loans across different lenders.\r\n- **Action Items**: Clear \"To-Do\" list for pending KYCs, e-sign requests, or upcoming EMI payments.\r\n- **Financial Health**: Real-time credit score display with history tracking.\r\n\r\n### 8.2 Smart Discovery & Comparison\r\n- **Lender Marketplace**: Filter lenders by loan type (Personal, Business, Agri), tenure, and interest rate bands.\r\n- **Smart Match**: \"Recommended for You\" section based on the user's credit profile and business sector.\r\n- **Government Schemes**: Dedicated tab for subsidized loan schemes (e.g., Mudra, Startup India) with one-click eligibility checks.\r\n\r\n### 8.3 Application Management\r\n- **One-Time KYC**: Upload documents once to the central ULI locker; share with multiple lenders via consent.\r\n- **Real-time Tracking**: Status timeline for each application (Submitted → Under Review → Approved → Disbursed).\r\n- **In-App E-Sign**: Digitally sign loan agreements using Aadhaar-based OTP.\r\n\r\n### 8.4 Repayment & Treasury\r\n- **Auto-Pay Mandates**: Set up recurring UPI mandates or eNACH for EMIs.\r\n- **Foreclosure Simulation**: Calculator to see savings on early repayment.\r\n- **Secure VPA**: Unique virtual address (e.g., `borrower_id@uli`) for receiving disbursements and making repayments.\r\n\r\n### 8.5 Support & Grievance\r\n- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) for failed transactions or incorrect charges.\r\n- **Multilingual Support**: Interface available in 12+ Indian languages for inclusivity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 9️⃣ API Specifications (Borrower Module)\r\n\r\nThis section outlines the core RESTful endpoints exposed to the Borrower App. These APIs interact with the central ULI switch and the connected Lender/Bureau nodes.\r\n\r\n### 9.1 Identity & Onboarding\r\n\r\n**`POST /api/v1/borrower/register`**\r\n> Initiates the user profile creation. It accepts basic details (mobile, email, name) and creates a unique ULI ID (e.g., `user@uli`). This ID serves as the primary handle for all future lending transactions and consent management.\r\n\r\n**`POST /api/v1/borrower/kyc/upload`**\r\n> Handles the secure upload of identity documents (PAN, Aadhaar, etc.). The API routes these documents to the Central Document Validation Service (CDVS) for OCR and authenticity checks. It returns a transaction ID to track the verification status.\r\n\r\n**`GET /api/v1/borrower/kyc/status`**\r\n> Polls the status of the submitted KYC documents. It returns the verification result (Verified/Rejected) from the CDVS. If rejected, it provides specific error codes (e.g., \"Image Blurred\", \"Name Mismatch\") to guide the user in re-uploading.\r\n\r\n### 9.2 Credit & Eligibility\r\n\r\n**`POST /api/v1/credit/eligibility-check`**\r\n> Triggers a real-time fetch of the borrower's credit report from connected Credit Information Companies (CICs). It calculates the \"ULI Score\" based on the standardized algorithm and determines if the user meets the baseline criteria to enter the marketplace.\r\n\r\n**`GET /api/v1/credit/score-card`**\r\n> Retrieves the calculated ULI Score and a summary of the credit health. This is used to populate the \"Financial Health\" dashboard, showing the user their score trend, active trade lines, and any negative flags that might affect loan approval.\r\n\r\n### 9.3 Marketplace & Discovery\r\n\r\n**`GET /api/v1/market/lenders`**\r\n> Fetches a filtered list of available lenders based on the user's profile and search criteria (Loan Type, Amount, Tenure). It returns lender metadata, including their interest rate bands, processing fees, and \"Success Rate\" for similar profiles.\r\n\r\n**`POST /api/v1/market/quote-request`**\r\n> Multicasts a \"Pre-Approval Request\" to selected lenders. It shares a masked version of the borrower's profile (Credit Score, Income, Sector) with lenders to solicit exact interest rate quotes without revealing personally identifiable information (PII) initially.\r\n\r\n### 9.4 Loan Lifecycle Management\r\n\r\n**`POST /api/v1/loan/apply`**\r\n> Submits a formal loan application to a specific lender after the borrower selects a quote. It includes the unmasked profile data and consent artifacts. This triggers the lender's internal underwriting engine (Rule Engine) for a final decision.\r\n\r\n**`POST /api/v1/loan/{loanId}/accept`**\r\n> Captures the borrower's acceptance of the final Loan Agreement. It triggers the e-signing process (via Aadhaar OTP) and generates the \"Loan Sanction Letter\". Once successful, it signals the lender to initiate the disbursement process.\r\n\r\n**`GET /api/v1/loan/portfolio`**\r\n> Retrieves the consolidated list of all active and closed loans linked to the borrower's ULI ID. It provides key details for each loan, including Outstanding Principal, Next EMI Date, Interest Rate, and a link to the repayment schedule.\r\n\r\n### 9.5 Repayment & Settlement (UPI/BBPS Integration)\r\n\r\n**`POST /api/v1/repayment/mandate/create`**\r\n> Sets up an auto-debit mandate (eNACH or UPI Autopay) for loan repayment. It redirects the user to their UPI app to authorize the recurring debit limit. This ensures EMIs are deducted automatically on the due date, reducing default risk.\r\n\r\n**`POST /api/v1/repayment/pay-manual`**\r\n> Generates a dynamic UPI payment link or QR code for ad-hoc payments (e.g., missed EMI, part-payment, or foreclosure). It integrates with the Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS) to instantly settle funds into the lender's collection account.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 🔟 Scenario-Based API Workflows\r\n\r\nTo illustrate how the generic APIs (Section 9) adapt to specific use cases, here are the strict data flows for the three primary loan categories.\r\n\r\n### 10.1 Personal Loan: Electric Vehicle (Bike) Financing\r\n**Actor**: Salaried Individual | **Loan Type**: Vehicle Loan (Green Finance)\r\n\r\n1.  **Profile Setup**:\r\n    *   Call `POST /borrower/register` with `type: \"INDIVIDUAL\"`.\r\n    *   Upload Salary Slips via `POST /kyc/upload`.\r\n2.  **Discovery**:\r\n    *   **Request**: `POST /market/quote-request`\r\n        ```json\r\n        {\r\n          \"loanType\": \"VEHICLE\",\r\n          \"assetDetails\": { \"type\": \"EV_SCOOTER\", \"price\": 120000, \"dealerId\": \"HERO_01\" },\r\n          \"amount\": 100000,\r\n          \"tenureMonths\": 24\r\n        }\r\n        ```\r\n    *   **Logic**: The system flags this as a \"Green Loan,\" potentially unlocking lower interest rates (e.g., 10-12%).\r\n3.  **Disbursement**:\r\n    *   Upon `POST /loan/{id}/accept`, the loan amount (₹1L) is **not** sent to the borrower.\r\n    *   **Settlement**: The system triggers a direct payment to the **Dealer's VPA** (`hero.motors@bank`) to prevent fund diversion.\r\n\r\n    ```mermaid\r\n    flowchart LR\r\n        A[Borrower Accepts Loan] --> B[Lender Disburses Funds]\r\n        B --> C{Asset Type?}\r\n        C -->|Vehicle| D[Direct Transfer to Dealer VPA]\r\n        C -->|Cash| E[Transfer to Borrower VPA]\r\n        D --> F[Dealer Confirms Receipt]\r\n        F --> G[Asset Delivery]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### 10.2 Business Loan: MSME Working Capital\r\n**Actor**: Small Business (Proprietorship) | **Loan Type**: Working Capital / Overdraft\r\n\r\n1.  **Profile Setup**:\r\n    *   Call `POST /borrower/register` with `type: \"ENTITY\"`, `entityType: \"PROPRIETORSHIP\"`.\r\n    *   Input GSTIN.

Interest is charged only on the utilized amount.\r\n\r\n    ```mermaid\r\n    flowchart TD\r\n        A[GST Data Fetch] --> B[Turnover Analysis]\r\n        B --> C[Credit Line Approved]\r\n        C --> D[Borrower Requests Drawdown]\r\n        D --> E[Funds Transferred to Current A/c]\r\n        E --> F[Interest Meter Starts]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### 10.3 Agri Loan: Kisan Credit Card (KCC)\r\n**Actor**: Farmer | **Loan Type**: Crop Loan\r\n\r\n1.  **Profile Setup**:\r\n    *   Call `POST /borrower/register` with `type: \"FARMER\"`.\r\n    *   Link State Land Records (e.g., Bhoomi/Dharani ID).\r\n2.  **Discovery**:\r\n    *   **Request**: `POST /market/quote-request`\r\n        ```json\r\n        {\r\n          \"loanType\": \"AGRI_KCC\",\r\n          \"cropSeason\": \"RABI\",\r\n          \"landAcreage\": 2.5,\r\n          \"crop\": \"WHEAT\"\r\n        }\r\n        ```\r\n    *   **Logic**: System checks \"Scale of Finance\" for Wheat in that district to determine max loan eligibility.\r\n3.  **Disbursement**:\r\n    *   Funds credited to a KCC Savings Account.\r\n    *   Includes mandatory Crop Insurance deduction (Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana).\r\n\r\n    ```mermaid\r\n    flowchart TD\r\n        A[Farmer Links Land Record] --> B[Verify Ownership & Acreage]\r\n        B --> C[Check Scale of Finance on Crop]\r\n        C --> D[Calculate Loan Limit]\r\n        D --> E[Disburse to KCC Account]\r\n        E --> F[Deduct Insurance Premium]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1️⃣1️⃣ AI-Driven Intelligence Layer\r\n\r\nThe ULI platform leverages advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to democratize credit access. This layer moves beyond static rule-based engines to dynamic, context-aware decision-making. This Decision Engine is a key differentiator of ULI. This is completely just an alternative supportive measure to the conventional credit score calculation systems. Although Money borrowers and Lenders will always have access to traditional credit scoring systems. \r\n\r\n### 11.1 Holistic Credit Scoring (Beyond Bureau Data)\r\nTraditional scores rely heavily on past repayment history. The ULI AI Engine incorporates **Alternative Data** to assess intent and capability.\r\n\r\n*   **For Individuals:**\r\n    *   **Behavioral Analytics:** Analyzes utility bill payments, e-commerce spending patterns, and savings regularity.\r\n    *   **Loan-Specific Risk:** A home loan applicant is scored differently from a personal loan applicant based on asset stability.\r\n*   **For Businesses (MSMEs/Startups):**\r\n    *   **Macro-Economic Factors:** Adjusts risk scores based on real-time inflation/deflation trends and sectoral growth (e.g., boosting scores for Sunrise Sectors like EV/Solar).\r\n    *   **Market Sentiment:** Scrapes news and social sentiment to gauge brand health.\r\n    *   **Stock/Commodity Correlation:** For agri-traders or manufacturers, the AI analyzes raw material price volatility against their inventory.\r\n\r\n### 11.2 Intelligent Lender Matching\r\nInstead of a flat list, the **Recommendation Engine** pairs borrowers with the *right* lenders.\r\n*   **Risk Appetite Matching:** High-risk, high-growth startups are matched with Venture Debt funds rather than conservative PSU banks.\r\n*   **Success Prediction:** Uses historical data to predict which lender is most likely to approve a specific profile, reducing rejection fatigue.\r\n\r\n### 11.3 Additional AI Use-Cases\r\n*   **Voice-First Interface (NLP):** Allows rural borrowers to interact with the app in their native dialect (e.g., *\"Mujhe kheti ke liye loan chahiye\"*), breaking literacy barriers.\r\n*   **Predictive Cash-Flow Alerts:** Warns businesses of potential liquidity crunches *before* they happen, suggesting timely working capital top-ups.\r\n*   **Fraud Guard:** Detects synthetic identities and circular trading patterns in real-time.\r\n\r\n**AI Decision Flow**:\r\n```mermaid\r\nflowchart TD\r\n    subgraph Input Data\r\n    A[Traditional Bureau Data]\r\n    B[Alt Data: Utility/GST/Social]\r\n    C[Macro Factors: Inflation -Deflation rate/Sector of Operation]\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    subgraph ULI AI Engine\r\n    D{Contextual Risk Model}\r\n    A --> D\r\n    B --> D\r\n    C --> D\r\n    D --> E[Dynamic Credit Score]\r\n    D --> F[Lender Affinity Score]\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    subgraph Output\r\n    E --> G[Borrower Dashboard]\r\n    F --> H[Smart Lender List]\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: This is just a Mockup of the AI Decision Engine. The actual AI Decision Engine will be more complex and shall be based on the latest research in AI and Machine Learning.And also there is another factor ,governement bodies will not easily drop the existing credit scoring systems and switch to automated AI Decision as the primary source of truth.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1️⃣2️⃣ Next Steps (What the borrower will do after reading this doc)\r\n\r\n1. Create a personal or business profile.\r\n2. Upload required KYC documents.\r\n3. Use the credit‑score calculator.\r\n4. Browse the lender marketplace, apply for a quote.\r\n5. Accept the loan offer and receive a payment‑link.\r\n6. Repay via UPI, NEFT, or the in‑app bill‑pay flow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*This blueprint is intended as just a mockup and do not represent any governemt legal body or any existing system.*\r\n","title":"ULI - Unified Lending Interface - Part One","description":"A schematic mockup documentation and representation of how an ideal goverment app shall function for a borrower, which is currently in pilot phase and being implemented by RBI.","tags":["SystemDesign","ULI","RBI","FinTech","Finance-app"],"npmUrl":"","date":"2025-12-01","githubUrl":"","docsUrl":null,"imageUrl":"/images/uli-india.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
